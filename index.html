        <h2>Artist Statement</h2>

        	<p>In my work, I contest the status quo of “life”. Through the use of garment construction, I
          make reference to specific eras, conventional societal standards and my own view of “Heaven on
          Earth”.	 I interact with thought of a utopian world and what that may intel. In turn I also describe
          what a dystopian world may intel. Both these notions fuel my work so that it may reflect on
           “what could be” and “what is”.</p>
        	<p>The process that I take when creating my work is detrimental for me. When I am
          producing works it is some what ritualistic and holy in a sense. All of the skills that I have
          attained come into play as if they are tools for a surgeon. The materials I use are also important. I
           vehemently identify as a textile artist and therefore the vast majority of my work uses textiles.
            My use of textiles and fabric starts with my family. I am a member of the Gee’s Bend Quilters
             Guild by blood relation and an innate enjoyment for sewing. My choice of material reflects my
              personal aesthetic and it also neglects it simultaneously.</p>
        	<p>In relation to my aesthetic I tend to incorporate fashion notions within my work. My love
           for fashion comes from experiencing a lack of. This is not necessarily my own lack of but my
            peers. I have bared witness to the ridiculing and the diminishing of a person’s self-esteem simply
             because of the clothes they were wearing. This act has lit a fire within that pushes me to confront
              the tormenting of others.</p>
        	 <p>Often times in the fashion industry expensive items are seen as more desirable. This
            notion leaves those who can not afford them in a rut and state of disdain. I want to convert the
             desires of expensive into rarity. While most expensive items are already ubiquitous there should
              be some items sold at more economical prices and its value simply come from it’s uniqueness
               alone. This would allow those who can not afford the pricier items a shot at obtaining a piece.</p>
        	<p>Periodically I sale my garments to higher bidding buyers, while saving certain ones to
           sale to those galleries and individuals who are not as affluent. The feeling that I got when I
            purchased my first expensive item was exhilarating. It was a pair of black and white Saint
             Laurent biker jeans from their Fall 2013 line. It was my first time feeling quality materials,
              impeccable construction and that higher fashion taste. This is something that I want everyone to
               feel at least once in their lifetime.</p>
